# Intrusion-detection-system

TOOLS USED:
Python, Tkinter, psutil, socket, threading, logging

It is a cutting-edge solution designed to safeguard computer networks and systems from unauthorized access and malicious activities.
It plays a vital role in enhancing network security and notifies you when your data is accessed by a suspicious person.

Developed a real-time Intrusion Detection System GUI using Python and Tkinter to monitor and validate
incoming IP addresses.
◦ Implemented IP authorization checking and automated alerting, enabling prompt detection and simulated
blocking of unauthorized IPs.
◦ Created logging and alert modules to record and notify suspicious activity via popup warnings and system
log files.
◦ Applied system resource monitoring using the psutil library to track and display CPU and memory usage,
simulating host-level anomaly detection.

Let me highlight some of the key features of our IDS project:
IP Address Monitoring: Our system can track and analyze incoming IP addresses to determine if they are authorized or suspicious.

System Resource Monitoring: It continuously monitors CPU and memory usage, alerting users to abnormal activity that may indicate an intrusion or system issue.

Blocking Suspicious IP Address: Our IDS also blocks the unauthorised IP addresses thereby preventing the malicious activities.
you might be wondering why this matters. Here are a few reasons:
Protecting Your Data: By using our IDS, you can protect your sensitive data and personal information from falling into the wrong hands.
Business Security: For organizations, this system can be a critical component in safeguarding customer data and business operations from cyber threats.
Tech Advancement: This project is at the forefront of technology, using advanced techniques to detect and respond to security breaches.
In conclusion, our Intrusion Detection System is a valuable project that addresses a pressing issue in today's digital world. It empowers individuals and organizations to defend against cyber threats and ensure the security of their systems and data. We believe that this project is not only important but also worth exploring and implementing in various contexts.
