# Intrusion-detection-system

TOOLS USED:
Python, Tkinter, psutil, socket, threading, logging

It is a cutting-edge solution designed to safeguard computer networks and systems from unauthorized access and malicious activities.
It plays a vital role in enhancing network security and notifies you when your data is accessed by a suspicious person.

Developed a real-time Intrusion Detection System GUI using Python and Tkinter to monitor and validate
incoming IP addresses.
◦ Implemented IP authorization checking and automated alerting, enabling prompt detection and simulated
blocking of unauthorized IPs.
◦ Created logging and alert modules to record and notify suspicious activity via popup warnings and system
log files.
◦ Applied system resource monitoring using the psutil library to track and display CPU and memory usage,
simulating host-level anomaly detection.

Let me highlight some of the key features of our IDS project:
IP Address Monitoring: Our system can track and analyze incoming IP addresses to determine if they are authorized or suspicious.

System Resource Monitoring: It continuously monitors CPU and memory usage, alerting users to abnormal activity that may indicate an intrusion or system issue.

Blocking Suspicious IP Address: Our IDS also blocks the unauthorised IP addresses thereby preventing the malicious activities.
